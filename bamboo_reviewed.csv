I signed up last year, made some stock investments that have yielded very significant returns (one of my stock picks in particular is still surprising me to this day).

Multiple payment options and enough guides on what to do and not do. Communication is good, although I am yet to try customer service. Good app.",5
Excellent app. I have had no issues working with Bamboo. I applaud your responsive support teams. Your recent update was great. My 2 recommendations will be ; 1. To include a feature to add personal notes to my portfolio. This will help me keep track of todo' like if to increase/reduce my position after an earnings report or specific event . 2. Please include trade/transaction history in the individual portfolio page. The general history is great but I will appreciate having a log within.,5
Exciting. Simple and very functional,5
"What I love most about Bamboo is its transparency, to see how stock are moving even before depositing in one's account. It would be great to have the feature to deposit any amount subsequently until $20 min is reached before allowing to trade ‚Äîthat's what held me up for not starting to invest in time. So, it will be better to be able to deposit in small amount until it accumulates to the preferred amount. It's a great app!",5
very good and easy to navigate,5
This is a very nice app for growing your stock. keep it up üëç,5

This virtual card would enable users to make online purchases seamlessly, expanding their options and convenience. Thank you.",5
seamless and easy to use,5
Easy inter phase for beginners and professionals also having easy deposit and withdrawals.,5
bamboo is one of the best if not the best at the moment i love this app 100%,5
Bamboo makes things easy especially for first timers. It's highly recommended for fresh users,5
"I like the new update although there's a glitch in the UI. After login in, when you try to relogin using your fingerprint, the finger print button is right next to the ""not , switch account"" action. So trying tap on the fingerprint results in the app logging the current user out most times; except you're extremely cautious.",5
"Sincerely, so far so good! It's a five star experience for me. Bamboo navigation is cool. Reponce is swift.",5
"It was amazing, though I had some challenges of funding earlier but a friend helped me out. I wish that one do invest on fix return for at least a month or two so that when you tell people about it, they can be able to invest. Some people cannot wait for 90 days when trying something new.",5
It's a great app for investing. It doesn't matter your level of experience with stick investment. The app is self explanatory and analysis are top notch. I wish there could be a notification on price increase or decrease of your favorite stock to make quick decision.,5
"The app is as sleek as they come, really fluid and easy to use. The features are clear and navigation is adequate. I particularly like that explanations to each feature is on hand once you click on the right icon. All in all it's a great app!",5
"Exceptional experience but something should be added. A function where you can set price drop and price rise notifications for the stocks in your watchlist. THAT WOULD BE THE FINAL TOUCH. apart from that, this app is pretty superb.",5
"Very good app. I don't have any complains yet. Excellent customer care services, nice UX/UI, and has a learning feature for beginners. I think it will be nice if you add more chart options and include pre-market updates.",5
"This app is truly exceptional, innovative and easy to use. For as little as 20 dollars anyone can start investing in American stocks suck as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon. Using this was a great decision. The user experience is great, with explanatory articles and a great fast response customer service. There are no ads and no suspicious requests.",5
"I have always wanted a way into the US stock market because I am pro-investmet and a longterm person at that. Ever since downloading the app I have learned more about the stock market and drawn up a list of 100 companies to invest in. The app is seamless, easy-to-use, and handles your investment portfolio in a hugely transparent way. I have gladly recommended the app to friends, colleagues, and family.",5
"It easy to understand, I love the way they created locate and international acc on the app, I did suggest you add more investment on the app, like binary, forex and crypto, you should think of creating a bamboo universe card,making transfers to other bamboo account. I believe this app could grow behind just an investing app to a banking app, where a lot of investment and transaction hold with strong security.",5
"I believe this message meets any of the app user. Firstly, I was thinking this app was a scam but to my surprise it wasn't. The reason why I thought it was a scam was when I wanted to withdraw money, I was stressed not knowing I haven't followed up according to the instructions giving. Not until I followed the procedure properly before it was successful. I really enjoy the app. Its an app that can be recommended when it comes to trading and stocking. You are the best.. more improvement ahead.",5
"I'm not used to sacrificing my precious time to offer reviews, but in the case of Bambooüëå-- I couldn't hold back. From my experience, bamboo outperforms other trading platforms in so many ways. In addition, when it comes to my Money, Credibility and Speed are my major concern-- and Bamboo does it best!",5
"Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Bamboo is fantastic. I can buy stocks of global brands from the convenience of my smart phone with my Naira account and I don't need to have a lot of money to invest. I can invest with even just N1,000. Bamboo makes it very very easy to decide on an investment, with historical share price and performance ratios, analyst opinion, and latest news on a stock. Look & layout is amazing, intuitively amazing. Customer service very responsive. Well done! Take my money!",5
"Took a while to understand the app, had it for months but didn't use it cz I just didn't get it üòî, till my friend explained how, it works to me few month ago. Better late than never, yeah? üòâ... -IMPROVEMENTS The stocks should be arranged in such a way that going back and forth isn't tiring... It'd be nice to add something like ""search history"" Please ""Dark mode"" option. I",5
"Easy & simple to use. A great investment app for investment in the US stocks. I really like their quick response to queries, execution of transactions & stock confirmation statements. Another great feature is the educational resource they provide on the US capital market. Great for beginners & experts alike.",5
"Smooth, easy to use, great charts, fast updates. Overall, awesome user experience!!! Recommendation: please develop a price alert feature that notifies the investor when a certain set price being monitored is reached.",5
"Okay, apart from the fact that my first deposit took about 3 days to reflect on my dash board, I reached out to the customer service and they responded quickly and everything was sorted out. My second deposit was really fast and instant. Buying stocks on the app is so easy. I also love the analysis. I can gladly recommend this app to my friends. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5
This is a very good investment platform. I am still learning the process of using bamboo though. The UI is very friendly and easy to navigate. Lessons are customised and easy to access on YouTube. I recommend this app to those who are ready to grow financially and buy shares from different companies.,5
"For one thing, the Bamboo app is easy to navigate. Customer service, on point! Talk about beautiful in-app designs. The stock market news updates very good. Then their blog, educative. I like the way the different stocks are classified, otherwise called 'themes'. I know they have it in plan to feature Nigerian stocks...this in itself is good. I just hope the NSE would be profitable to investors.",5
great platform for investing. I really like it especially because you can invest fractionally. I really wish it would automatically signed out of the account anytime I close the app though. but apart from that ......üí™üí™üí™,5
"I must appreciate the team for bringing this idea to life with such an amazing UI. At the moment, everything is just fine. Simple and detailed, fast execution and seamless investing. I recommend to anyone looking forward to long term investing.",5
"BAMBOO has really been helpful to me. The app is easy to use and they offer courses that take you from zero knowledge about investing to an informed investor. Every decision you make on the app is not out of blindness you are informed. I took the course and now I don't take any decision both on the app or other investment without applying everything learnt in the course. The good thing is, it's completely free. Imagine gaining knowledge on money for free.",5
"The experience so far has been great. The only thing that needs to be looked into is that after a deposit, the error message can be removed and I am glad we can get a receipt after making a deposit in case of any issue. So just remove the error message so it will not cause any doubt. Great app. 5 Stars.",5
I love the fact that you already helped sort out the ones that are based on Halal principles. Not to talk of the person that responded to my questions in simple terms with examples. Or the tutorials suggestions on the company on buy or hold or sell and many more. More power to your elbows. You guys are the best.,5

Overall, this course is an invaluable resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of investing.",5

"I'm a beginner and so far, this is the first app I'm using to trade. I not only find it easy but the support team has always been there to answer all my questions. I think I'm really making a lot of mistakes now though as a beginner but the bamboo support team makes whole process fun. All thanks to the bamboos upport team",5
"The app is okay, and user friendly. Very helpful with quality of information made available on the platform. Though, being a new investor on the app comes with its own challenges getting used to the system, but with BambooTeam timely responses to questions I'll get through with time. #sure.",5
"This app is great. I use various investment apps, but this one is nice and legit with good customer service, but pls the app shuts down whenever I try depositing and therefore hindering me from putting in any of my money for investment. Only about twice I've succeeded in getting through. NOTE: Most people might not invest into this app because of this problem",5

Please I'm a student, can you guys make it flexible for everyone.Abeg.",5
"Absolutely love the app! Everything seems to be designed to meet my needs. Very user friendly and intuitive. The only downside is the commission charged for every purchase and sale of stock. It should be reduced if possible. Overall, great app. I recommend.",5
"Intelligent Computing Introduction to Investment - As can be expected with anything that is built on the platform of computing, it serves as a means of getting into investment, particularly in American stocks which seem to be held to a higher level of compliance and transparency with regards to the performance and operations of the listed stocks. I feel more comfortable with them. Great way for someone who has no previous knowledge in stocks to get started.",5
Using Bamboo has been such a great experience. I have been using the app for a while now and it has been a smooth ride. Their insightful stock market course was a part of the foundation for my journey into investing in the US stock market. Looking forward to seeing new investment opportunities on Bamboo in the future.,5

It is also easy to navigate and engage with, while a great clue about each stock could be gleaned from the news column, instantly combining both the function of stock interface and insight. It is the best US stock app for us here in Nigeria. Once the Nigerian stocks are added, none would rival it",5
"This is among the best! Everything is legit, withdrawal is very fast The app is to be trusted! When you invest, it keeps running as you want, Not scam, you can receive payment if any currency, user friendly, I recommend it to everyone, once you provide your details, they will help you in every aspect you are interested in, good customer service, Everything about you is protected, this is the type of app play store should be allowing here, if you are yet to download yours, do it it right now....",5

Thank you Bamboo for bringing to us this opportunity and we pray for more growth üíπ.",5
